# SarkaarSamjho: Understand Government Policies Easily

This is SarkaarSamjho, your friend who will help you understand government policies and rules. Think of it as a friend who explains heavy government rules and policies to you in simple language. That's what SarkaarSamjho does - a chatbot that understands your language and makes government rules and policies easy for you to understand.

## Our Goal

SarkaarSamjho's goal is for everyone to have information about government rules and policies. We want to reduce the gap between the government and citizens, and ensure that citizens have complete information about their rights, responsibilities, and financial policies.

## How it Works

To run SarkaarSamjho, we use the latest language models trained on government policy datasets. We use RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and the LLaMA2 model to create a chatbot that can understand your questions and provide appropriate answers.

We have specifically trained our chatbot on various government policies so that you can get accurate information on topics like taxes, investments, and loans.

## Made for You

We understand that everyone's need for information about government policies is different. That's why SarkaarSamjho provides answers based on your questions. Whether you are a small business owner trying to understand tax regulations or a student seeking information on education loans, our chatbot will provide relevant answers for you.

## The Way Forward

Currently, SarkaarSamjho can only communicate in English, but we plan to introduce it in more languages soon, so that everyone has the opportunity to learn about government policies in their native language.

## Always Up-to-Date

Government rules and policies keep changing frequently. We will regularly update SarkaarSamjho's dataset so that you always have access to the latest information.

# Project Deployment

We used Google Colab's T4 GPU to train the llama 2 model, we have'nt deployed it anywhere as we're broke af rn ðŸ˜…, if u want to do the same, download my notebook and run it in google colab with hardware acceleration of T4 GPU, create a folder called "data" to store your custom dataset, you can also change your dataset here, and it can be trained on whatever dataset u like, train the model and run the query engine

# Project Demo

We have'nt deployed it due to cost issues, so here's a glimpse of how the model works -  https://www.loom.com/share/b44f73a9e771416f8cfeb6b9088f62e5?sid=9b2e1af6-172d-4429-bfe8-abc1ba67871d
